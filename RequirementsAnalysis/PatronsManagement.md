## Improvement Proposal:

### Suggested Improvements:

-   Extend the validation logic to handle more edge cases, such as duplicate membership numbers or invalid contact details.
-   Add soft delete to keep pattern data but stop using it for future use.

### Justification:

-   Improving validation will reduce the likelihood of errors in the system and enhance the reliability of patron management.
-   Soft delete to keep the data for reports but stop using it for the future without affecting data that already used that information

### Impact on Development:

These improvements will increase the robustness of the system. However, they may require refactoring.

## Main Conclusion:

The system effectively meets the requirements for patron management
